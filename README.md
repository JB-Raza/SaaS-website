<!-- hero section -->
the button is not being animated along with other .hero-animated-data



<!-- check it later -->
bg images are not being loaded and are coming from assets folder.


<!-- current task -> making of custom pricing component -->
i have to send jsx in place of heading, and paragraph to add unique styling on each of them
i have to send an object of cards data to show.


<!-- other important issues -->
my animations are bit hard then the original one.
on lg screens. the event listener on navitems should not exist. like when i click on the navitem on lg screens, it doesn't seem to be working but actually its working as the angle icon is taking effect from it.

if a non existing route is requested. show 404 page without navbar or footer.

the bg image of card is hiding when i hover over the card and the bg color i applied maybe overriding the bg image on hover in Pricing.jsx
