use cases to handle:

show voucher code if applied.
include delivery charges in formData and in orderSchema


the discount should also be shown before placing order in checkout page as total price. lets say discount is 10%, at price is $1000, then total price should be shown $900. right now it is not shown like that. (also include voucher discount to show if possible)

in wishlist, if one variant has 0 quantity left, it should add item of next variant on click. also give a link to see product details to redirect him to product details page.

add to cart through wishlist issue (we can add more items than the total quantity of products available), the size is not mentioned
