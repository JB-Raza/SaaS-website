<!-- hero section -->
the button is not being animated along with other .hero-animated-data

on lg screens. the event listener on navitems should not exist. like when i click on the navitem on lg screens, it doesn't seem to be working but actually its working as the angle icon is taking effect from it.

if a non existing route is requested. show 404 page without navbar or footer.
